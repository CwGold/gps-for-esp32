ICON FILES NEEDED:

Create these two PNG files:
- icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

Quick creation method:
1. Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Upload any image with a location pin or camera
3. Download generated icons
4. Rename to icon-192.png and icon-512.png
5. Add to this repository

Design suggestion:
- Purple gradient background (#667eea to #764ba2)
- White location pin icon 📍
- Optional: "GRIZCAM" text

Temporary workaround:
The PWA will still work without icons, but won't look as polished.
Browser will use a generic icon until you add custom ones.
